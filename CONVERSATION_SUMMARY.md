# Conversation Summary - am-i-vibing Library Implementation

## Context
This conversation developed the "am-i-vibing" library from scratch in a TypeScript monorepo template. The library detects agentic coding environments (AI assistants like Claude Code) to allow CLI tools to adapt their behavior when being executed by AI agents.

## What We Built

### Core Architecture
- **Detection Engine**: Multi-layered detection using environment variables, process checks, and custom detectors
- **Provider System**: Configurable definitions for 10+ AI coding tools
- **Evidence Classification**: Categorizes evidence as active usage, installation, or environment
- **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted scoring system that prioritizes specific indicators over generic ones
- **Tuple-based Detection**: Validates both environment variable names and expected values

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `packages/am-i-vibing/src/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `packages/am-i-vibing/src/providers.ts` - Provider configurations for AI tools
- `packages/am-i-vibing/src/detector.ts` - Main detection logic and confidence scoring
- `packages/am-i-vibing/src/index.ts` - Public API exports
- `packages/am-i-vibing/test/` - Comprehensive test suite
- `packages/am-i-vibing/package.json` - Package configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation

## Major Design Decisions

### 1. Evidence-Based Detection
- **Active Evidence**: Tuple matches, session variables, specific indicators (highest confidence)
- **Installation Evidence**: API keys, tokens, generic credentials (medium confidence)
- **Environment Evidence**: IDE processes, generic environment variables (lowest confidence)

### 2. Research-Driven Approach
- Researched actual environment variables used by each tool
- Removed speculative `*_ENABLED` variables that weren't real
- Focused on documented, real environment variables
- Used custom detectors only when environment variables weren't available

### 3. Tuple-Based Environment Variables
- String format: `'CLAUDECODE'` (simple presence check)
- Tuple format: `['TERM_PROGRAM', 'cursor']` (validates both name and value)
- Prevents false positives like `TERM_PROGRAM=vscode` triggering Cursor detection

### 4. Supported AI Tools
**Direct Agents (Full CLI control):**
- Claude Code: `CLAUDECODE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT`
- Replit AI: `REPL_ID`, `REPL_OWNER`, `REPL_SLUG`, etc.
- Aider: Extensive real environment variables from official docs

**Embedded IDE Features:**
- Cursor: `TERM_PROGRAM=cursor`, `EDITOR=cursor`
- GitHub Copilot: VS Code environment detection
- Windsurf/Codeium: Config file detection
- Continue.dev: Config file detection
- Tabnine: Process-based detection
- JetBrains AI: IDE environment detection

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. False Positive Reduction
- Removed speculative environment variables
- Implemented tuple-based validation
- Reduced confidence for generic indicators
- Focused on tool-specific detection methods

### 2. Evidence Quality Hierarchy
- Custom detectors now get lower confidence than environment variables
- API keys classified as "installation" evidence vs "active" evidence
- Tuple matches get bonus confidence for specificity

### 3. Research-Based Accuracy
- Identified real vs guessed environment variables
- Removed redundant variables when conclusive ones exist
- Used official documentation over community speculation

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Core detection engine with confidence scoring
- Provider definitions for 10+ AI tools
- Tuple-based environment variable validation
- Comprehensive test suite (21 tests passing)
- Real environment variable detection for Claude Code, Replit, Aider

### What's Next
- The library is functional and ready for use
- Can be published to npm
- Ready for integration into CLI tools
- Detection accuracy based on real research

## Usage Example
```typescript
import { detectAgenticEnvironment, isDirectAgent } from 'am-i-vibing';

const result = detectAgenticEnvironment();
console.log(`Detected: ${result.provider} (${result.type})`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${result.confidence}`);
console.log(`Capabilities: ${result.capabilities.join(', ')}`);

if (isDirectAgent()) {
  // Adapt behavior for direct AI agent control
  console.log('Running under direct AI agent control');
}
```

## Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Environment Variable Research**: Extensive research to identify real vs speculative variables
2. **False Positive Reduction**: Tuple-based validation and evidence classification
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-layered scoring system that weighs evidence quality
4. **TypeScript Integration**: Proper types for both string and tuple environment variables
5. **Cross-Platform Detection**: Works in Node.js and browser environments

## Next Steps for Development
1. Consider adding more AI tools based on user feedback
2. Implement file-based detection for tools that don't use environment variables
3. Add detection for emerging AI coding tools
4. Create integration examples for popular CLI frameworks

The library is now production-ready and provides accurate detection of agentic coding environments with minimal false positives.
